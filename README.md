# 1. Overview

This project is for translating python codes in single_tmaze project by Johnson379725 to Java codes for accelerating GA processing (https://github.com/Johnson37975725/single_tmaze). 

# 2. Single T-Maze task
An agent with a hebian neural network tries to solve t-maze task (see below). The neural network is evolved by GA (Genetic Algorithm).
